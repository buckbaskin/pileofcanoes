# YoCad: A Software For Stubborn Throwers 
  This software is designed to allow anyone to design their yoyo from
  a rudimentary command line interface. The design of the yoyo is done
  in four user created files.

  1. specs.txt
  
  2. profile.txt

  3. rim.txt

  4. cup.txt 

  Currently, as of 2017.11.09, 2,3, and 4 do not actively interface w/
  'specs.txt', however it will (and must) in the future.

  There is only one file which contains bearing seat information, and
  it is called 'BearingSeatCoords_C.txt'
